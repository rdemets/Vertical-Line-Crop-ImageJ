# Motivations


The aim of this macro is to crop large stacks of vertical microfluidic channels into smaller chunk.

## How to install

Drag and drop the file into Fiji and press Run.

## Requirements

This macro requires a fresh install of Fiji. The program expect CZI files with multiple series of Zstack.

## How to use

The macro works in batch mode and will not display any result for memory purpose.
<br>MIP and ZIP of the ROIs are saved for QC.
